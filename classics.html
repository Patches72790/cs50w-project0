                        Plato (423 BC – 348 BC) was a Classical Greek philosopher, mathematician, student of Socrates,
                        writer of philosophical dialogues, and founder of the Academy in Athens – the first institution
                        of higher learning in the Western world. Along with his mentor, Socrates and his student,
                        Aristotle, Plato helped to lay the foundations of Western philosophy and science. Plato
                        influenced a whole range of subjects from philosophy to maths, logic and ethics.

                        Marcus Tullius Cicero was a Roman orator, statesman and writer. He was born on the 6th January
                        106 BCE at either Arpinum or Sora, 70 miles south-east of Rome, in the Volscian mountains. His
                        father was an affluent eques and the family was distantly related to Gaius Marius. He is not to
                        be confused with his son (of the same name) or Quintus Tullius Cicero (his younger brother).
                        Cicero died on the 7th December 43 BCE, trying to escape Rome by sea.

                        Marcus Aurelius reigned as Roman emperor from 161 to 180 CE and is best known as the last of the
                        Five Good Emperors of Rome (following Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius) and as the
                        author of the philosophical work Meditations. He has long been respected as embodying the
                        Platonic concept of the Philosopher King as articulated in Plato’s Republic: a ruler who does
                        not seek power for his own sake but to help his people. He was introduced to philosophy at a
                        young age and his Meditations, composed while on campaign in his fifties, make clear that he
                        held a deeply philosophical, specifically Stoic, view throughout his life.

                    <p>
                        Aesop (c. 620-564 BCE) was an Ancient Greek fabulist or story teller credited with a number of
                        fables now collectively known as Aesop's Fables. Although his existence remains uncertain and
                        (if they ever existed) no writings by him survive, numerous tales credited to him were gathered
                        across the centuries and in many languages in a storytelling tradition that continues to this
                        day. Many of the tales are characterized by animals and inanimate objects that speak, solve
                        problems, and generally have human characteristics. (Villa Albani, Rome, Italy)
